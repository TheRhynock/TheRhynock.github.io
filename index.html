    <p>Test Individually, and as a group, the younger generation of Trumps speaks with more grace than their father as they make the same points. Simply put, they are chips off the old block. Yes, they have been polished and smoothed in ways that their father has not. But their instincts and sense of entitlement are consistent with his. This is why they believe that despite their lack of knowledge and experience they can serve as adept advisers.
What matters is not knowing things, but knowing what Donald Trump wants. In a similar vein, they believe, as he does, that Trumps don't get enough credit and should be regarded as American royalty.</p>
